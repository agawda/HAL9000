## What project does:
- Robot collects book information for gratis and promo books
- Book information collected at minimum is: title, genre, author(s), promo details, price
- If book has subtitle, it's collected as well
- Web-UI
- Book information is collected from 3 DIFFERENT libraries (screen scraping or REST API)
- Robot runs once per day, results are appended
- Run results are persisted in DB
- Runs are logged along with their statistics 
- Project mantra

## How to run project:
The project contain scripts that can be executed to run the applications. The command that needs to be executed is 
`sh mainScript.sh` and should be executed from the directory above the HAL9000 directory. 
 The application it runs are: the spring application which communicates with the db and works in Tomcat container at
  port 8080. The other app is executed every 3 hours and scraps the results from following bookstores:
- Gandalf
- Matras
- Bonito
- GoogleBooks

The scripts contain also script for cloning and switching to master branch `cloning.sh` but it is not enabled by default 
in the main script (with assumption that the user already cloned the repository to get those scripts)
